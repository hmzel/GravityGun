# Gravity Gun

Made in 1.8.8 and tested in 1.19.3, should work in all versions between the two and onward.
<br><br>
Just a funny lil plugin i decided to make to get back into coding after my 2 week break to study for the GED.
<br>
All you have to do is run /gravitygun while holding any item and itll turn that item into a gravity gun!
<br><br>
Has 3 different modes:
<br>
Velocity, which uses velocity to move your target
<br>
Teleport, which uses teleportation to move your target
<br>
and Blocks, which turns blocks within a certain area into falling blocks and moves them around, letting you place them back whereever. 
<br><br>
Theres also other features like left clicking to throw your target(s), and using the scroll wheel to move your target closer or further away.
<br><br><br>
And of course, a funny screenshot which showcases the Blocks mode:
